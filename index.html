             <h3>My academic journey</h3>
             <p> I started my educational path in Zaatara Basic School, which is one of the oldest schools in the village, built in the early 1950s, until I graduated from Zaatara Girls Secondary School, which graduated many successful doctors, engineers, and students. I graduated with  98.7 in the scientific stream. Since I was young, I was among the outstanding students, despite my neglect of studies at times, but when I was determined to succeed and excel, I obtained my first certificate of appreciation in the tenth grade and I was among the top students in school. Thank God, not a semester passed after that without me being among the distinguished students and recipients of certificates of excellence.
                Then I decided to major in software engineering at Bethlehem University, for many reasons.
                and I'm now in my third year at the university, and thank God, since I entered the university, I have been and still am among the outstanding in many fields and I have participated in many programming competitions and external activities.</p>

             <p>I live in the village of Zaatara, south of Bethlehem, a small village crowned with olive and almond trees. Its houses are compact and close together. Every house has a story and every place has a story. Its people are simple and honorable, from whom we learned strength, manhood, pride and dignity.
                The doctor, engineer, soldier, teacher and farmer grew up there.
               They all struggled and worked hard despite the difficult circumstances, and we are all proud of them.
               Despite all the occupation's practices of abusing its people and destroying its landmarks, it is steadfast and patient.
               The occupation destroyed Al-Tahadi School several times, the last time was about two months ago and prevented its construction. Despite this, lessons are given to students in tents without a building.
               I am very proud to be a part of it and I pray to God to protect it from all evil... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIGaHks8-Us" title="Za'tara village" >more</a></p>

             <p> Success and great victories begin with your trust in God, your faith in yourself and your continuation on the path of good without despair or surrender .
                For me, I believe that great achievements do not have to be a prize that I received or an event that others are amazed by, 
                every useful work, even if it is small, that I do every day improved my personality , health or increased my faith is a great achievement, 
                and I thank God and thank myself for that <br> How proud I am of myself when I hear the center’s children competing for me to be their teaching supervisor.
                Because I work as a teacher for children in our educational center (Balsam Center for Learning and Creativity).
               <br>Recently, I opened my first hobby as a business project under the title “ Artist’s Touch ” for Making Resin Antiques, which was the focus of my interest before that.
                I participated in many university activities and programming competitions (ex. Hult_Prize, Hebron_Code_Jam, PCPC_2023, Quantum_Computing_Hackaton)  <br>All the activities and competitions that I participated in, whether at University, School or in my personal life,
                 are achievements and experiences that have taught me a lot and I am proud of them</p>

                  then we would start aiming stones at them and damaging them, and the first person to break them wins.
                I was often the winner in this challenge, and because of my ability to aim accurately, 
                I greatly improved my development in the sport of archery.</p>

I try to create my joy and happiness in the simplest situations and things.<br> The smiles of an innocent children, a sincere old pepole's prayers, the smell of the basil rose placed on the window of my room early in the morning, the beginning of winter and seeing children dancing and singing happily under the first drops of rain that returned after a long hiatus to revive the earth after its death. Transforming my ideas and imagination into colorful drawings and artistic paintings. and Sitting on the dirt hill in the middle of our farm, under the almond tree that my grandfather planted many years ago, to bid farewell to the setting sun.
                Meditation and contemplation of nature and God’s creatures restores the spirit and life to the body, all of these things make me happy .

                Therefore, we must remember our noble Messenger’s life, imitate his words and actions, follow his commands, and avoid his prohibitions.
                We make him a role model in our lives to win in this world and the hereafter and to meet him in Paradise.
                The Messenger is undoubtedly my role model in my life, and I am not saying that I have all of the Messenger’s morals, attributes, and commands, but I try hard to have him always present in myself and my morals.</p>
